# Eurotech IoT Development Kits
Eurotech IoT Development Kits provide a complete, high-quality design environment for engineers and solution architects to significantly accelerate the development and delivery of new IoT applications. 

The IoT Development Kits bundle industrial grade hardware platforms with pre-installed and configured software development environment so any prototype can be quickly turned into a production ready unit. 
The kit targets all aspects of an IoT application from hardware interfacing, to development of on-board software, and cloud connectivity. 

The IoT Development Kit family targets a variety of IoT application requirements by providing a range of different hardware platforms, spanning from very compact low-power ARM-based designs to powerful multi-core, latest generation Intel Atom gateways. 

**Each IoT Development Kit packages all the necessary hardware and software components to bootstrap a new project: gateway, cable and accessories, network connectivity options, IoT middleware framework, and cloud connectivity.**
